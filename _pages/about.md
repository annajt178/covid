# About

Covid Helpline is a non-profit, open source, community driven initiative created to raise awareness and boost communication about the current Coronavirus outbreak. We make the latest updated data obtained from [John Hopkins University’ Covid-19 data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) available via SMS, along with important tips and news about Covid-19.

# Why is this important?

The biggest issue about pandemics is communication. As of today, 10% of the U.S population does not use the internet. 42% of older adults are part of that group. The vast majority of Americans – 96% – now own a cellphone of some kind. Of that 96% of Americans only 81% owned a smartphone. We also have 91% of Americans age 65+, who own some type cellphone, of that share 39% of the group do not own a smartphone. Still, these numbers are more extremes in developing countries.

These stats are extremely important; People at higher risk of contracting COVID-19 are older adults and people who have severe chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease. According to early CDC data, it is suggested that older people are twice as likely to have serious COVID-19 illness.

Making this information accessible via text, along with the latest Coronavirus news, and the CDC advice about how to stay safe would greatly aid mankind in it’s quest to control this fatal virus. Covid Helpline is a reasonably easy and cheap solution to this issue.
