# About us

Covid Helpline is a non-profit, open source, community driven initiative created to raise awareness and boost communication about the current Coronavirus outbreak. We make the latest updated data obtained from [John Hopkins Universityâ€™ Covid-19 data repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports) available via SMS, along with important tips and news about Covid-19.
