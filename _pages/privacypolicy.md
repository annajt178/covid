# Privacy Policy
Your privacy is important to Covid Helpline so we’ve developed a Privacy Policy that covers how we collect, use, disclose, transfer, and store your personal information.

##  How we store and secure the Personal Information we collect
Covid Helpline takes the security of your personal information very seriously. When your personal data is stored by Covid Helpline, we use computer systems with limited access housed in facilities using physical security measures. 

When you use other products, services, or applications or post on forums, chat rooms, or social networking service, the personal information and content you share is visible to other users and can be read, collected, or used by them. You are responsible for the personal information you choose to share or submit in these instances. For example, if you list your name and email address in a forum posting, that information is public. Please take care when using these features.

<br>

## Our Companywide Commitment to Your Privacy 
To make sure your personal information is secure, we communicate our privacy and security guidelines to Covid Helpline employees and strictly enforce privacy safeguards within the company.
